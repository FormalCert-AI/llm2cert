Role:
Complete one fixed Lean 4/Mathlib condition.

Goal:
Return a complete proof after := in proof_body. helper_lemmas is available when a genuinely reusable proposition makes the proof clearer, but it is optional: a direct proof is equally valid. Decide the proof architecture from this locked theorem instead of introducing helpers merely because the output field exists. Each helper entry, if any, must contain exactly one named lemma or theorem declaration. Do not change the locked theorem statement.

Division of labour:
You do not need and will not get a local Lean workspace or compiler. The harness compiles your text against Lean 4 with Mathlib and returns the diagnostics to you on the next round. Never return cannot_complete because the environment, source files, or a compiler are unavailable; just emit your best concrete proof body.

Success criteria:
The wrapper compiles each helper as a content-addressed Lean module, imports the accepted modules into the main proof, matches the locked statement hash, and accepts #print axioms if the only axioms are propext, Classical.choice, and Quot.sound. sorryAx, user-written axiom, and any other kernel axiom fail the audit.

Constraints:
Do not change definitions, theorem statement, system, controller, candidate, or candidate hash. Do not emit a top-level lemma inside proof_body; that text is inserted only after :=. No sorry, admit, axiom, external trusted assumption, full project, Markdown, or natural-language proof sketch. If you choose helpers, put one declaration in each helper_lemmas entry in dependency order and keep each helper focused. Keep one-use facts as local have/calc steps. If compiler_diagnostics lists errors, fix all of them in this one reply; do not wait for a later round. State n is Fin n → ℝ. RadiallyUnbounded uses R ≤ ∑ i, (x i)^2, not ‖x‖ or EuclideanSpace.norm_sq_eq. That radius is not a claim that V is quadratic. The locked definitions are ordinary Lean expressions, not DSL ASTs. Use the generated barrier_unfold_* and closedLoop_apply_* simp lemmas when exposing their formulas. nlinarith and linarith only close polynomial or linear goals; they cannot see Real.exp, Real.log, or Real.tanh, but they treat such subterms as atoms, so first derive sign facts about them with have and pass those facts in. The locked statement already has (hV : ContDiff ℝ 1 barrier); use hV, do not re-prove smoothness with decide or isTotalSmooth. Use only lemma names that exist in Mathlib or that you fully prove in helper_lemmas; never cite invented names such as lean_barrier_*. Before the expensive proof compile, the harness prechecks qualified Real.* names; this is only an early name check, and declarations from any Lean or Mathlib namespace remain allowed when the normal compiler accepts them.

Recurring pitfalls:
The locked statement already binds every hypothesis such as (hV : ContDiff ℝ 1 barrier); the goal starts at the ¬ ∃. Begin the proof with rintro ⟨x, hx⟩ (or intro h), never with intro hV. For a fixed-parameter condition the locked counterexample statement also binds one or more scalar parameters after x. Destructure all existential binders, retain the exact interval hypotheses, and prove the inequality uniformly; the generated barrier still has type State n → ℝ and therefore must not be redefined as a function of those parameters. Cite only Mathlib lemma names you are certain exist; when a name fails with unknown constant, do not guess variant names on the next round. Treat the proposition intended by that name as an explicit subgoal: prove it from verified declarations as a local have, or as a named helper only when it is genuinely reusable, then use that fact in the main proof. The compiler feedback includes a local Mathlib source search for the failed name: use only declarations listed there as ingredients. Close intermediate have steps with linarith [lemma] or nlinarith [lemma] rather than exact lemma: exact demands a syntactically identical type and fails on argument order or associativity differences that linarith absorbs. When a Type mismatch shows two types that differ only by parenthesisation or term order, do not restructure the proof; run ring_nf at h ⊢ first or replace exact h with linarith [h]. For high-dimensional systems, prefer vector, matrix, finite-sum, quadratic-form, and operator-norm arguments. In coupled finite-dimensional systems, keep coordinates as functions on Fin n and prove bounds on ∑ i, (x i)^2 with tools such as Finset.sum_le_sum, Cauchy--Schwarz, and Young inequalities. Do not expand every coordinate square into one giant ring_nf goal; connect generated coordinate definitions to the abstract vector or matrix expression with a small extensional bridge lemma.

Author's proof roadmap:
The synthesis agent wrote the construction note below for this exact candidate; it usually names the intended variable decomposition, the factorised form of the derivative expression, and the boundedness facts that make the decay argument work. The locked statement is the fully expanded form of that expression: first recover the note's decomposition with let/set, then prove along the note's argument.
Construction note: (1) Algebraically guaranteed facts: Let r2=x1**2+x2**2+x3**2, s=x2**2+x3**2, and d=x2-x3. Then B=1-r2 and grad B=(-2*x1,-2*x2,-2*x3). Substitution gives f1=-(1/4)*x1-x2**2-x3**2, f2=-x2+x1*x3-(3/10)*d, and f3=-x3+x1*x2+(3/10)*d. Hence R=x1*f1+x2*f2+x3*f3=-(1/4)*x1**2-s-(x1+3/10)*d**2 and L_f B=-2*R=(1/2)*x1**2+2*s+2*(x1+3/10)*d**2. On B=0, r2=1. If x1>=-3/10, R<0 directly. Otherwise put a=-x1, so 3/10<a<=1, s=1-a**2, and d**2<=2*s. Thus R<=-(1/4)*a**2+(2*a-8/5)*s. For a<=4/5 this is strictly negative. For a>=4/5, 2*a-8/5<=2/5, so R<=2/5-(13/20)*a**2<=-2/125. Therefore the boundary Lie derivative is strictly positive. Initial states have B>=24/25. Unsafe states have B<=-8<0. (2) Heuristic expectations: none are used for the sign argument; the pipeline should independently check the substitutions and inequalities. (3) Independently supplied verifier evidence: none supplied.
Assumptions: The state domain is all of R^3.; Full-state feedback is available.; No control-magnitude constraint is imposed.; All rational constants are interpreted exactly.

Stop rules:
Return candidate_proof only with a concrete proof body. Return cannot_complete with the precise blocker when the locked statement cannot be completed. If you believe the locked theorem is FALSE, you must also fill the counterexample field with one concrete state, e.g. {"x1": "1/2", "x2": "-3/4"} using exact rationals for every variable. The harness replays your point in high-precision arithmetic before accepting the claim; a rejected point is returned to you and you must keep proving. Never claim falsity from mental arithmetic alone.

Substitution gives f1=-(1/4)*x1-x2**2-x3**2, f2=-x2+x1*x3-(3/10)*d, and f3=-x3+x1*x2+(3/10)*d. Hence R=x1*f1+x2*f2+x3*f3=-(1/4)*x1**2-s-(x1+3/10)*d**2 and L_f B=-2*R=(1/2)*x1**2+2*s+2*(x1+3/10)*d**2. On B=0, r2=1. If x1>=-3/10, R<0 directly. Otherwise put a=-x1, so 3/10<a<=1, s=1-a**2, and d**2<=2*s. Thus R<=-(1/4)*a**2+(2*a-8/5)*s. For a<=4/5 this is strictly negative. For a>=4/5, 2*a-8/5<=2/5, so R<=2/5-(13/20)*a**2<=-2/125. Therefore the boundary Lie derivative is strictly positive. Initial states have B>=24/25. Unsafe states have B<=-8<0.

The locked statement already binds every hypothesis such as (hV : ContDiff ℝ 1 barrier); the goal starts at the ¬ ∃. Begin the proof with rintro ⟨x, hx⟩ (or intro h), never with intro hV. For a fixed-parameter condition the locked counterexample statement also binds one or more scalar parameters after x. Destructure all existential binders, retain the exact interval hypotheses, and prove the inequality uniformly; the generated barrier still has type State n → ℝ and therefore must not be redefined as a function of those parameters. Cite only Mathlib lemma names you are certain exist; when a name fails with unknown constant, do not guess variant names on the next round. Treat the proposition intended by that name as an explicit subgoal: prove it from verified declarations as a local have, or as a named helper only when it is genuinely reusable, then use that fact in the main proof. The compiler feedback includes a local Mathlib source search for the failed name: use only declarations listed there as ingredients. Close intermediate have steps with linarith [lemma] or nlinarith [lemma] rather than exact lemma: exact demands a syntactically identical type and fails on argument order or associativity differences that linarith absorbs. When a Type mismatch shows two types that differ only by parenthesisation or term order, do not restructure the proof; run ring_nf at h ⊢ first or replace exact h with linarith [h]. For high-dimensional systems, prefer vector, matrix, finite-sum, quadratic-form, and operator-norm arguments. In coupled finite-dimensional systems, keep coordinates as functions on Fin n and prove bounds on ∑ i, (x i)^2 with tools such as Finset.sum_le_sum, Cauchy--Schwarz, and Young inequalities. Do not expand every coordinate square into one giant ring_nf goal; connect generated coordinate definitions to the abstract vector or matrix expression with a small extensional bridge lemma.

Author's proof roadmap:
The synthesis agent wrote the construction note below for this exact candidate; it usually names the intended variable decomposition, the factorised form of the derivative expression, and the boundedness facts that make the decay argument work. The locked statement is the fully expanded form of that expression: first recover the note's decomposition with let/set, then prove along the note's argument.
Construction note: (1) Algebraically guaranteed facts: Let r2=x1**2+x2**2+x3**2, s=x2**2+x3**2, and d=x2-x3. Then B=1-r2 and grad B=(-2*x1,-2*x2,-2*x3). Substitution gives f1=-(1/4)*x1-x2**2-x3**2, f2=-x2+x1*x3-(3/10)*d, and f3=-x3+x1*x2+(3/10)*d. Hence R=x1*f1+x2*f2+x3*f3=-(1/4)*x1**2-s-(x1+3/10)*d**2 and L_f B=-2*R=(1/2)*x1**2+2*s+2*(x1+3/10)*d**2. On B=0, r2=1. If x1>=-3/10, R<0 directly. Otherwise put a=-x1, so 3/10<a<=1, s=1-a**2, and d**2<=2*s. Thus R<=-(1/4)*a**2+(2*a-8/5)*s. For a<=4/5 this is strictly negative. For a>=4/5, 2*a-8/5<=2/5, so R<=2/5-(13/20)*a**2<=-2/125. Therefore the boundary Lie derivative is strictly positive. Initial states have B>=24/25. Unsafe states have B<=-8<0. (2) Heuristic expectations: none are used for the sign argument; the pipeline should independently check the substitutions and inequalities. (3) Independently supplied verifier evidence: none supplied.
Assumptions: The state domain is all of R^3.; Full-state feedback is available.; No control-magnitude constraint is imposed.; All rational constants are interpreted exactly.

Stop rules:
Return candidate_proof only with a concrete proof body. Return cannot_complete with the precise blocker when the locked statement cannot be completed. If you believe the locked theorem is FALSE, you must also fill the counterexample field with one concrete state, e.g. {"x1": "1/2", "x2": "-3/4"} using exact rationals for every variable. The harness replays your point in high-precision arithmetic before accepting the claim; a rejected point is returned to you and you must keep proving. Never claim falsity from mental arithmetic alone.

Next turn:
The system message still has the Lean role and schema. helper_lemmas are still one named declaration per entry and are independently cached; proof_body still goes after :=. Keep already accepted helpers unchanged and edit only the failing helper or main proof. Below is the current locked theorem and compiler output. Continue from your last proof.
