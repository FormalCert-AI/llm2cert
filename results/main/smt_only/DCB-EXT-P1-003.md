Role:
You are a control theory expert specializing in Lyapunov functions. Propose one Lyapunov certificate V and an explicit controller.

System information:
System name: DynaCertBench System 083 · DCB-EXT-P1-003 · Extend-Table~4 \#2 (SineModel), \cite{edwards2024fossil}
Problem id: dcb_ext_p1_003
System semantics: continuous-time
Dynamics: dx1/dt = (x2 + u1); dx2/dt = (u2 + ((80/3) * (((2943/4000) * sin(x1)) - ((1/10) * x2))))
State variables: x1, x2
Control variables: u1, u2
Formal state domain X: x1 in [-1, 1], x2 in [-1, 1]
Control set U: u1 in [-5, 5], u2 in [-5, 5]
Controller observations: full-state feedback
FastCheck screening box: x1 in [-1, 1], x2 in [-1, 1]
Initial set X_i: none
Unsafe set X_u: none
Assumptions: Deterministically normalized from canonical record DCB-EXT-P1-005.; Decimal source constants are interpreted as exact rationals; no floating approximation enters Lean.
Task type: stability
Stability kind: local_exponential
Claimed domain: bounded N
Origin policy: exclude_point

Mathematical framework:
The certificate is a Lyapunov function V, not a barrier. This task does not choose a level constant or a smaller certified sublevel: all claimed conditions are on the fixed domain the neighborhood N.
V(x*) = 0 at the equilibrium, and V(x) > 0 for every other point of the domain.
Exclude the equilibrium by the symbol x != x*, not by deleting a ball around it.
A sublevel set may appear in a conceptual Lyapunov argument, but it must not be used to exclude a counterexample from the fixed claimed domain.
Decrease rate: D_pi V = grad V · f.
Exponential stability: give positive rationals exp_c1, exp_c2, exp_c3 such that c1 ||x||^2 <= V(x) <= c2 ||x||^2 and D_pi V + c3 V <= 0 on the neighborhood N.
All certificate checks use the closed-loop dynamics after substituting the given controller. The given controller must satisfy pi(x) in U on the neighborhood N.

Objective:
Propose V in the certificate expression string and, only for exponential stability, the required exact decay constants. Do not introduce level_c or replace N by a candidate-chosen sublevel set. Do not change N. Never write verified, proved, certified, UNSAT, or globally valid unless that result is already in the supplied evidence. Jointly design the required controller inside the declared control set U. Among formally valid controllers, prefer a structurally simple one with modest magnitude on X. Try a constant, linear, or affine controller first; use a nonlinear controller only if those simple forms cannot satisfy the formal conditions.

Certificate-family discipline:
Choose the simplest certificate structure justified by the dynamics, domain, and verification conditions. Non-polynomial dynamics do not by themselves require a non-polynomial certificate. Use transcendental or rational terms only when construction_summary gives a concrete identity or inequality showing how they help close the required condition. Ensure every expression is well-defined on X. Structure examples only. Polynomial: for dx1/dt = -x1 + x1*x2 and dx2/dt = -x2 on x1**2 + x2**2 <= 1, V = x1**2 + x2**2 gives D V = -2*x1**2*(1-x2) - 2*x2**2 <= 0. Non-polynomial: for dx1/dt = -x1*(1+x1**2), V = log(1+x1**2) gives the exact identity D V = -2*x1**2, with 1+x1**2 > 0.

Constraints:
Use only declared state variables (x1, x2). Do not leave free symbols such as delta or epsilon. Every controller assignment must obey the Controller observations information pattern shown above; the pipeline rejects the candidate after parsing if an assignment reads any other state. Return certificate and controller expressions as concise strings; never emit recursive AST nodes. Numeric literals are parsed as exact rationals: 0.01 becomes 1/100, and 1/100 is also fine. The name pi denotes the exact constant Real.pi; do not replace it by a decimal approximation. Allowed function names: sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan,ln,tan,sec,csc,cot,sinh,cosh,sech,csch,coth,arctan,atanh. log is the natural logarithm. sqrt(arg) requires arg >= 0 on X; atan is the two-sided inverse tangent; atanh(arg) may be used only when -1 < arg < 1 on X. Names other than sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan are expanded to the stored AST before verification; for example sech(x1) becomes 2/(exp(x1)+exp(-x1)). The equivalent square-root spellings sqrt(x), x**(1/2), and x**0.5 are all accepted and normalized to the same exact AST. Division of expressions is allowed, for example x1**2/(1+x1**4); write parentheses when the denominator is a sum. Do not invent other function names and do not use Abs. The pipeline symbolically differentiates V and independently checks the continuous-time queries. construction_summary is a construction note, not a certificate; downstream Lean proof agents read it as their roadmap, so it must name the useful auxiliary quantities, give a factorised form of the Lie expression grad V dot f_cl in those quantities, and list the boundedness facts with explicit constants that close the sign inequality.

Do not change the condition or solver eligibility. direct_lean must return an empty solver_order. smt must return a complete permutation of the eligible backends. SMT results are checked independently and may be rescued by Lean4. When the counterexample query includes a bounded fixed parameter, keep it as an ordinary quantified query variable: UNSAT means no violating pair (x,w) exists and therefore establishes the uniform condition. Do not treat the parameter as a state coordinate or as a certificate variable.
