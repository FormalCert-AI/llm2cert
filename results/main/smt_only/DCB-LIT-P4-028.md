Role:
You are a control theory expert specializing in barrier functions and invariant sets. Propose one barrier and an explicit controller for the system below.

System information:
System name: DynaCertBench System 063 · DCB-LIT-P4-028 · ~\texttt{S057}, \cite{taheri2025barrierbench}
Problem id: dcb_lit_p4_028
System semantics: continuous-time
Dynamics: dx1/dt = (-(x1) + ((2/25) * x2) + ((x1)**2 * x2) + u0); dx2/dt = ((((3/5) - ((2/25) * x2)) - ((x1)**2 * x2)) + u1)
State variables: x1, x2
Control variables: u0, u1
Formal state domain X: R^n (unbounded; no screening-box bounds occur in formal queries)
Control set U: not required
Controller observations: full-state feedback
FastCheck screening box: x1 in [-6, 6], x2 in [-6, 6]
Initial set X_i: true  (also x1 in [(1/10), (1/2)], x2 in [1, 2])
Unsafe set X_u: ((x1)**2 + (x2)**2) >= 25
Assumptions: Deterministically normalized from canonical record DCB-LIT-P4-028.; Decimal source constants are interpreted as exact rationals; no floating approximation enters Lean.

Mathematical framework:
Find a C1 barrier B on the full space X = R^n. The finite screening box is only for FastCheck and must not be used to justify a global claim such that C = {x in X | B(x) >= 0} is a super-level invariant (B >= 0, not B <= 0).
Condition 1: B(x) < 0 for every unsafe state x in X_u ∩ X. If an initial set X_i is present, every x in X_i ∩ X must satisfy B(x) >= 0.
Condition 2 (strict boundary): for every x in X with B(x) = 0, L_f B(x) = ∇B(x) · f(x) > 0.
Compute ∇B and L_f B yourself before proposing B. Prefer an analytic expression that a solver can check. Do not use trajectories or the vector field itself as the certificate. All formal checks are on X = R^n; the screening box is not a theorem bound.
All certificate checks use the closed-loop dynamics after substituting the given controller.

Objective:
First satisfy Condition 1 and Condition 2 on X. Cover X_i and exclude X_u. Only after those conditions look plausible, prefer a larger invariant set C; there is no volume score to optimize. B need not be polynomial. It may be built so that the Lie derivative has a controllable sign, including transcendental terms that cancel or dominate those in f. In construction_summary, separate (1) algebraically guaranteed facts, (2) heuristic expectations that still need the pipeline, and (3) independently supplied verifier evidence. Never write verified, proved, certified, UNSAT, or globally valid unless that result is already in the supplied evidence. Do not invent numerical minima, margins, solver outputs, interval bounds, or counterexamples. Later turns will add the failed candidate and independently verified counterexamples; diagnose that evidence directly and change the expression as needed. Coefficients-only edits are allowed but not required. Jointly design the required controller; no hard control set U was declared, so do not invent a bound. Among controllers that satisfy all formal conditions, prefer a structurally simple controller and prefer smaller gains or slower control-to-state growth, so control magnitude is not made unnecessarily large. Try a constant, linear, or affine controller first; use a nonlinear controller only if those simple forms cannot satisfy the formal conditions.

Certificate-family discipline:
Choose the simplest certificate structure justified by the dynamics, domain, and verification conditions. Non-polynomial dynamics do not by themselves require a non-polynomial certificate. Use transcendental or rational terms only when construction_summary gives a concrete identity or inequality showing how they help close the required condition. Ensure every expression is well-defined on X. Structure examples only. Polynomial: for dx1/dt = -x1 + x1*x2 and dx2/dt = -x2 on x1**2 + x2**2 <= 1, V = x1**2 + x2**2 gives D V = -2*x1**2*(1-x2) - 2*x2**2 <= 0. Non-polynomial: for dx1/dt = -x1*(1+x1**2), V = log(1+x1**2) gives the exact identity D V = -2*x1**2, with 1+x1**2 > 0.

Constraints:
Use only declared state variables (x1, x2). Do not leave free symbols such as delta or epsilon. Every controller assignment must obey the Controller observations information pattern shown above; the pipeline rejects the candidate after parsing if an assignment reads any other state. Return certificate and controller expressions as concise strings; never emit recursive AST nodes. Numeric literals are parsed as exact rationals: 0.01 becomes 1/100, and 1/100 is also fine. The name pi denotes the exact constant Real.pi; do not replace it by a decimal approximation. Allowed function names: sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan,ln,tan,sec,csc,cot,sinh,cosh,sech,csch,coth,arctan,atanh. log is the natural logarithm. sqrt(arg) requires arg >= 0 on X; atan is the two-sided inverse tangent; atanh(arg) may be used only when -1 < arg < 1 on X. Names other than sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan are expanded to the stored AST before verification; for example sech(x1) becomes 2/(exp(x1)+exp(-x1)). The equivalent square-root spellings sqrt(x), x**(1/2), and x**0.5 are all accepted and normalized to the same exact AST. Division of expressions is allowed, for example x1**2/(1+x1**4); write parentheses when the denominator is a sum. Do not invent other function names and do not use Abs. The pipeline symbolically differentiates B and independently checks the continuous-time queries. construction_summary is a construction note, not a certificate; downstream Lean proof agents read it as their roadmap, so it must name the useful auxiliary quantities, give a factorised form of the Lie expression grad B dot f_cl in those quantities, and list the boundedness facts with explicit constants that close the sign inequality.

Stop rules:
Return exactly one JSON object matching the schema. Put B or V in the certificate string. Put each control law in controllers[].expression. Do not output certificate_ast, controller_ast, kind, left, right, args, numerator, or denominator nodes. Never replace a failed attempt with a placeholder linear form just to return something.
