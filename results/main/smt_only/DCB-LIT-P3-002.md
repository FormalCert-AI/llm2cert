Role:
You are a control theory expert specializing in barrier functions and forward-invariant sets. Propose one barrier for the system below.

System information:
System name: DynaCertBench System 031 · DCB-LIT-P3-002 · Example~1, \cite{samanipour2026relu}
Problem id: dcb_lit_p3_002
System semantics: continuous-time
Dynamics: dx1/dt = x2; dx2/dt = ((sin(x1) - (3 * x1)) - (3 * x2))
State variables: x1, x2
Control variables: none
Formal state domain X: x1 in [-4, 4], x2 in [-4, 4]
FastCheck screening box: x1 in [-4, 4], x2 in [-4, 4]
Initial set X_i: none
Unsafe set X_u: (x1 < -(pi)) or (x1 > pi) or (x2 < -(pi)) or (x2 > pi)
Assumptions: Deterministically normalized from canonical record DCB-LIT-P3-002.; Decimal source constants are interpreted as exact rationals; no floating approximation enters Lean.; The paper fixes u=-3*x1-3*x2; it is substituted into the closed-loop dynamics, not synthesized as a free input.
Task type: invariant
Safety interpretation: outside_X_is_unsafe

Mathematical framework:
The certified set is C_B = {x | B(x) >= 0}. It must stay inside X and be forward invariant. States outside X are unsafe.
No nontrivial seed set is required.
B(x) < 0 for every unsafe state in the query.
On {x in X | B(x) = 0}, require the strict boundary condition L_f B > 0. All flow checks are only on X.

Objective:
Propose a C1 barrier whose super-level set is forward invariant and separated from the unsafe set. Do not alter or invent a seed set. Among candidates satisfying every required condition, make the volume of the certified invariant set as large as possible. Never write verified, proved, certified, UNSAT, or globally valid unless that result is already in the supplied evidence.

Certificate-family discipline:
Choose the simplest certificate structure justified by the dynamics, domain, and verification conditions. Non-polynomial dynamics do not by themselves require a non-polynomial certificate. Use transcendental or rational terms only when construction_summary gives a concrete identity or inequality showing how they help close the required condition. Ensure every expression is well-defined on X. Structure examples only. Polynomial: for dx1/dt = -x1 + x1*x2 and dx2/dt = -x2 on x1**2 + x2**2 <= 1, V = x1**2 + x2**2 gives D V = -2*x1**2*(1-x2) - 2*x2**2 <= 0. Non-polynomial: for dx1/dt = -x1*(1+x1**2), V = log(1+x1**2) gives the exact identity D V = -2*x1**2, with 1+x1**2 > 0.

Constraints:
Use only declared state variables (x1, x2). Do not leave free symbols such as delta or epsilon. Every controller assignment must obey the Controller observations information pattern shown above; the pipeline rejects the candidate after parsing if an assignment reads any other state. Return certificate and controller expressions as concise strings; never emit recursive AST nodes. Numeric literals are parsed as exact rationals: 0.01 becomes 1/100, and 1/100 is also fine. The name pi denotes the exact constant Real.pi; do not replace it by a decimal approximation. Allowed function names: sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan,ln,tan,sec,csc,cot,sinh,cosh,sech,csch,coth,arctan,atanh. log is the natural logarithm. sqrt(arg) requires arg >= 0 on X; atan is the two-sided inverse tangent; atanh(arg) may be used only when -1 < arg < 1 on X. Names other than sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan are expanded to the stored AST before verification; for example sech(x1) becomes 2/(exp(x1)+exp(-x1)). The equivalent square-root spellings sqrt(x), x**(1/2), and x**0.5 are all accepted and normalized to the same exact AST. Division of expressions is allowed, for example x1**2/(1+x1**4); write parentheses when the denominator is a sum. Do not invent other function names and do not use Abs. The pipeline symbolically differentiates B and independently checks the continuous-time queries. construction_summary is a construction note, not a certificate; downstream Lean proof agents read it as their roadmap, so it must name the useful auxiliary quantities, give a factorised form of the Lie expression grad B dot f_cl in those quantities, and list the boundedness facts with explicit constants that close the sign inequality.

Constraints:
Do not change the condition or solver eligibility. direct_lean must return an empty solver_order. smt must return a complete permutation of the eligible backends. SMT results are checked independently and may be rescued by Lean4. When the counterexample query includes a bounded fixed parameter, keep it as an ordinary quantified query variable: UNSAT means no violating pair (x,w) exists and therefore establishes the uniform condition. Do not treat the parameter as a state coordinate or as a certificate variable.
