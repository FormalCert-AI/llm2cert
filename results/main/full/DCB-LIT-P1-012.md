Role:
You are a control theory expert specializing in Lyapunov functions. Propose one Lyapunov certificate V and an explicit controller.

System information:
System name: DynaCertBench System 012 · DCB-LIT-P1-012 · Table~4 \#15 (DTAhmadi), \cite{edwards2024fossil}
Problem id: dcb_lit_p1_012
System semantics: discrete-time
Dynamics: x1[k+1] = (((3/10) * x1) + u1); x2[k+1] = (-(x1) + ((1/2) * x2) + ((7/18) * (x1)**2) + u2)
State variables: x1, x2
Control variables: u1, u2
Formal state domain X: x1 in [-1, 1], x2 in [-1, 1]
Control set U: not required
Controller observations: full-state feedback
FastCheck screening box: x1 in [-1, 1], x2 in [-1, 1]
Initial set X_i: none
Unsafe set X_u: none
Assumptions: Deterministically normalized from canonical record DCB-LIT-P1-012.; Decimal source constants are interpreted as exact rationals; no floating approximation enters Lean.; The source epsilon inner radius is provenance only; formal N includes the equilibrium.
Task type: stability
Stability kind: local_asymptotic
Claimed domain: bounded N
Origin policy: exclude_point

Mathematical framework:
The certificate is a Lyapunov function V, not a barrier. This task does not choose a level constant or a smaller certified sublevel: all claimed conditions are on the fixed domain the neighborhood N.
V(x*) = 0 at the equilibrium, and V(x) > 0 for every other point of the domain.
Exclude the equilibrium by the symbol x != x*, not by deleting a ball around it.
A sublevel set may appear in a conceptual Lyapunov argument, but it must not be used to exclude a counterexample from the fixed claimed domain.
Decrease rate: D_pi V = V(F(x)) - V(x).
Asymptotic stability: D_pi V < 0 on the domain minus the equilibrium.
All certificate checks use the closed-loop dynamics after substituting the given controller.

Objective:
Propose V in the certificate expression string and, only for exponential stability, the required exact decay constants. Do not introduce level_c or replace N by a candidate-chosen sublevel set. Do not change N. Never write verified, proved, certified, UNSAT, or globally valid unless that result is already in the supplied evidence. Jointly design the required controller; no hard control set U was declared, so do not invent a bound. Among controllers that satisfy all formal conditions, prefer a structurally simple controller and prefer a controller with modest magnitude on X instead of unnecessarily large gains. Try a constant, linear, or affine controller first; use a nonlinear controller only if those simple forms cannot satisfy the formal conditions.

Certificate-family discipline:
Choose the simplest certificate structure justified by the dynamics, domain, and verification conditions. Non-polynomial dynamics do not by themselves require a non-polynomial certificate. Use transcendental or rational terms only when construction_summary gives a concrete identity or inequality showing how they help close the required condition. Ensure every expression is well-defined on X. Structure examples only. Polynomial: for x1[k+1] = x1/2, V = x1**2 gives V(F(x1)) - V(x1) = -(3/4)*x1**2. Non-polynomial: for x1[k+1] = log(1+x1) on x1 >= 0, V = exp(x1)-1 gives V(F(x1)) = x1 and uses exp(x1) >= 1+x1.

Constraints:
Use only declared state variables (x1, x2). Do not leave free symbols such as delta or epsilon. Every controller assignment must obey the Controller observations information pattern shown above; the pipeline rejects the candidate after parsing if an assignment reads any other state. Return certificate and controller expressions as concise strings; never emit recursive AST nodes. Numeric literals are parsed as exact rationals: 0.01 becomes 1/100, and 1/100 is also fine. The name pi denotes the exact constant Real.pi; do not replace it by a decimal approximation. Allowed function names: sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan,ln,tan,sec,csc,cot,sinh,cosh,sech,csch,coth,arctan,atanh. log is the natural logarithm. sqrt(arg) requires arg >= 0 on X; atan is the two-sided inverse tangent; atanh(arg) may be used only when -1 < arg < 1 on X. Names other than sin,cos,exp,tanh,log,sqrt,atan are expanded to the stored AST before verification; for example sech(x1) becomes 2/(exp(x1)+exp(-x1)). The equivalent square-root spellings sqrt(x), x**(1/2), and x**0.5 are all accepted and normalized to the same exact AST. Division of expressions is allowed, for example x1**2/(1+x1**4); write parentheses when the denominator is a sum. Do not invent other function names and do not use Abs. This is a discrete-time Lyapunov task. Use only the one-step closed-loop map F_cl. The pipeline independently constructs and checks V(F_cl(x)) - V(x). construction_summary is a construction note, not a certificate; downstream Lean proof agents read it as their roadmap, so give a factorised one-step decrease expression and the exact bounds that close the required sign inequality. Use no continuous-time notation, flow argument, or Lie derivative.

Stop rules:
Return exactly one JSON object matching the schema. Put B or V in the certificate string. Put each control law in controllers[].expression. Do not output certificate_ast, controller_ast, kind, left, right, args, numerator, or denominator nodes. Never replace a failed attempt with a placeholder linear form just to return something.

Next turn:
The system message still has the problem, the locked task conditions, and the output schema. Do not wait for those sections to be repeated. Below is only new evidence: the failed candidate and independently verified counterexamples. Diagnose the failed condition yourself and propose the next candidate. Change the expression structure when coefficient tuning cannot address the evidence. Continue with discrete-time one-step Lyapunov semantics only: reason about F_cl(x) and V(F_cl(x)) - V(x). Use no continuous-time notation, flow argument, Lie expression, or strict boundary argument. This is P1 Stability: level_c is not part of the output contract and cannot restrict any obligation. Every counterexample in the fixed claimed domain N must be addressed by changing V or the controller; it may not be excluded by asserting V <= c.
